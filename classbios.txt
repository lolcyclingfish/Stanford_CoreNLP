------------------------------------------------------------

I was born and raised in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. I graduated summa cum laude from Knox College with a B.A. in Data Analytics and a minor in Economics after three years of study. Additionally, I was the John C. Weigel prize recipient for graduating as the senior with the highest academic achievement in my class.

I pursued data analytics to blend my enthusiasm for math and my strength for creative problem solving. When my school didn’t offer a major in the field, I designed the “Data Analytics” major, which was ultimately accepted and offered by Knox College’s curriculum committee. 

As a senior, I was selected to complete an undergraduate honors research project. I investigated student retention at Knox College and built a predictive model to identify students likely to leave prior to graduating, thus improving retention rates. In addition to my research, which was aimed to benefit my school, I stayed active on campus by tutoring math and computer science. With over 100 hours of tutoring logged, I utilized excellent communication skills and linguistic flexibility while I earned my level III master tutor certification through the College Reading and Learning Association. 

I have had three internships on two data science teams within the HERE organization, a mapping technologies company. Throughout my time on both teams, I frequently worked preparing and cleansing data for algorithm development. Most recently, I was an intern for Nielsen, a global information and measurement company. I worked on their E-Commerce team, analyzing online shopping data. I also created analytics surrounding Amazon Prime Day, Amazon’s busiest and most profitable day of the year. 

I decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Analytics at Northwestern University in the MSIA program to merge my educational experience with real world problem solving skills. I am eager to work closely with businesses on industry projects to prepare for a career of data science in an increasingly data-driven future.

I first became interested in Text Analytics when my team needed to perform sentiment analysis for a project during our first quarter in the MSIA program. We were analyzing Yelp and TripAdvisor reviews of various Chicago locations for an architecture firm. We used TF-IDF, but I felt we could have done more and gotten better insights if we had more exposure to different techniques. Additionally, at my internship at Nielsen, one of the most important projects being worked on is matching partial product descriptions to full product descriptions. When Amazon shoppers make a purchase, they receive an email with a truncated description of the product they bought. Since Nielsen is working with scraped email data, we only have access to this truncated description. In order to correctly apportion sales, text analytics is utilized to match the truncated to the full. Overall, I have seen and heard how prevalent and useful text analytics is, and I’m eager to learn such a valuable set of skills. 

In the future, I plan to work as a data scientist in the Chicagoland area. I have no particular field in mind, however, I am very interested in autonomous driving and I would love to get a chance to work on such a fascinating and paradigm shifting technology. 

 
** HW0: JONATHAN BURGE
------------------------------------------------------------

Although I was born in Delaware, I grew up on the other side of the country in a suburb of Seattle. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at Whitworth University, a liberal arts school in Spokane, Washington. It was through my coursework in computer science that I was exposed to artificial intelligence, natural language processing and machine learning. I found that leveraging statistics allowed for very interesting and effective solutions, and became interested in data science.

I first became interested in text analytics while taking an undergraduate class on artificial intelligence. As a part of an individual project I learned more about natural language processing and programmed a simple n-gram model for document classification and word prediction. I am interested in learning more about more sophisticated text analytics because of the volume of unstructured data to which it can be applied to gain value.

After graduating from MSIA I intend to stay in Chicago and begin full time employment. This summer I worked at Chatham Financial, a financial advisory company in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. During my time at Chatham I learned a lot about the valuation of various financial derivatives, risk analysis for commodity and foreign exchange exposures, as well as stochastic simulation techniques. This being, I am open to looking at full time opportunities outside of the finance sector, in areas including tech, healthcare, or consulting.

Outside of school, one of my primary hobbies is ultimate frisbee. I began playing ultimate frisbee during college, where I played with my university’s club team. Due to the time demands of school, I currently play at a fairly casual level. This summer I had the opportunity to play at a beach tournament in Wildwood, New Jersey. This is the largest annual beach tournament with over four hundred teams attending each year.

 
** HW0: SAM CARRUTHERS
------------------------------------------------------------

Oh hello, I didn't see you there. I'm Sam Carruthers, native of Evanston, and I can't seem to get away from this place. If that wasn't bad enough, both my parents are professors at Northwestern. Needless to say, I try and avoid the Sociology Dept. on my way to class. Thankfully, their offices are on the southern side of campus. Pre-MSiA, I went to Carleton College and majored in economics. Post-college, I worked in a marketing mix modeling consulting group at Nielsen, where I built models that estimated the effects of our clients' advertising efforts on their sales. We'd answer questions like "Was the increased effectiveness of the new TV ads worth the increased spend on 30 second spots and more expensive dayparts?" or "We are going to trim back our budget for FB mobile ads - where should we allocate those dollars to achieve maximum volume growth?" It was challenging and rewarding work, but after a couple years, I felt like I wanted to switch to a less niche and narrow field. Each client I worked with had its own data and statistical quirks and obstacles to overcome, but at the end of the day, marketing mix models are quite similar, and I was looking to move to an area where I could broaden my analytical toolset and enjoy a more varied day-to-day. I think the MSiA program prepares you quite well for that sort of work, as it exposes students to a large number of areas within data science, both in terms of areas of study and tools used. I'll graduate with a large foundation of knowledge and skills that I can build upon in my future career at TransUnion and beyond.

I probably have very similar motivations for taking text analytics as the other 35-odd people from my program - it's an area of data science I have very little familiarity, as I've exclusively worked with structured data at my job, classes, projects, etc. thus far, and so I want to take advantage of the opportunity offered by this class to gain at least some understanding. Furthermore, it seems like not a lot of my future coworkers have much experience with text analytics, and so being somewhat well-versed in the field would be a clear comparative advantage. 

Outside of my coursework, I like making data science puns and long walks on the beach. 

 
** HW0: LYDIA CHANG
------------------------------------------------------------

This is Lydia. Born and raised in China, I have been always fascinated by predicting human behavior using data, so I earned a bachelor’s degree in Statistics and Psychology from Rice University. Yet, the complexity and randomness of human behavior motivated me to learn more advanced analytics techniques and hone programming skills. Therefore, MSiA is a perfect fit for me.

Before joining the program, I worked as a data analyst with JD.com, the largest B2C online retailers in China. There, I took charge of analyzing massive user demography, behaviors and purchase history data. It was incredibly rewarding for me to predict consumer purchase intention by modeling and to improve the effect of precision marketing. It was also exciting for me to communicate with the internal business team and manufacturers’ partners, helping them make unbiased decisions through customized reports.

Past research experiences have helped me recognize that datasets are evolving rapidly in volume and complexity. With the rise of social media, the trend will be to leverage unstructured data like texts to understand customers better, guide business decisions, trim costs and lift sales. In short, the march of quantifying unstructured data will sweep through business, academia and government. Recognizing future trends in the field, I seek to acquire more complex knowledge about text analytics to make use of huge unstructured datasets.

In the future, I hope to apply my skills in a company where I can leverage data to understand customers better and tackle data-intensive issues. Also, I want to gain more experiences owning end to end large scale customer research projects and translate insights into actions. Ultimately, I want to be an expert in this field.

Beyond career, I am a travel and hiking enthusiast, amateur Chinese Folk dancer, and harp player. The motto I live by is “to travel is to live”.

 
** HW0: MICHAEL CHO
------------------------------------------------------------

I am originally from New Jersey. I came to MSIA after spending two years as a Risk Analyst, helping ecommerce companies with fraud. I first developed an interest in data science after taking a business statistics course at Duke. I was amazed how math and programming could be used to deliver solid advice to stakeholders in an organization. I took a job as a Risk Analyst at ACI. I worked with project managers and software developers, learning how fraud algorithms worked in an actual SaaS product and advising ecommerce clients like Macys. As I came from a non-technical background, I studied math and programming in the evenings and took a lot of courses on Coursera, all while working full time. I sought out a program that was rigorous and allowed me the opportunity to work on a lot of corporate projects. Northwestern seemed like the perfect opportunity to realize my interests. I became interested in text analytics after self-studying the topic and using regular expressions in various projects such as classifying FAQs from prospective applicants to the Northwestern MSIA program and scraping web data by patterns in nested html and json formats. I am also interested in the latest applications using deep learning architecture and word2vec to make sense of unstructured text data. My plan for the future is to apply my skills in ecommerce or consulting. Ecommerce has a breadth of data and Data Scientists can mine features to find out more about customers which seem fascinating to me. Consulting would allow me to gain a wide variety of experience and see how analytics is used across multiple business models. I am very excited to learn about this area of data science and increase my technical skills in this area. I hope to apply what I learn in class in my future projects.

 
** HW0: BRYCE CODELL
------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Bryce Codell. I grew up in Highland Park, Illinois, about fifteen miles north of Evanston. Prior to MSiA, I attended Swarthmore College, graduating in 2013 with a major in Economics and a minor in Statistics. During my time at Swarthmore, I spent a semester abroad in Sydney, Australia, and also played baseball. After graduation, I spent three years working as a Business Analyst for a privately held staffing company headquartered in the suburbs of Chicago. It was at this job that I got my first exposure to SQL and data analysis, as I was responsible for all ad hoc data requests and learned how to build dashboards to help colleagues manage their responsibilities using data. These experiences at work, combined with my brief introduction to statistical programming in R from my minor at Swarthmore, are what prompted me to look for a graduate degree in Analytics and what ultimately led me to apply to MSiA. I also learned a lot about how recruiters at that firm spent so much time manually scouring through resumes to validate applicants’ fit for different jobs, and it was learning about this process that first piqued my interest in text analytics. I spent this past summer interning in New York for a company called WeWork, which builds co-working spaces for other firms to share. I do not have a full-time offer yet, but I’m hoping to return to WeWork or another firm in New York after I graduate. I will also be applying to firms in Denver and San Francisco. I would like to work as a data scientist for a few years, then eventually move into a role as a product manager or pursue an entrepreneurial endeavor. On a personal note, I like to travel, can speak some Spanish and Italian, and enjoy watching baseball.

 
** HW0: ANNIE DIDIER
------------------------------------------------------------

Hola,

I’m Annie, and I hail from Washington. I like all the typical Washington things like coffee, grey skies, Linux - I mean Microsoft, skiing, and Nirvana. Not quite ready to leave the nest at 18, I did my undergrad at the small liberal arts school, Whitworth, nestled in the woods just 15 minutes from home. There I learned mathematics and how to catch a falling pinecone. 

 

After peaceful studies at Whitworth, I craved excitement beyond the pinecone curtain, so I joined Teach for America. They sent me to Atlanta, where I got more excitement than I bargained for. After this stint of teaching mathematics to high schoolers, I returned to the hermitian life of mathematics studies in graduate school. I received funding for the Applied Mathematics doctoral program in Phoenix, so I traded in my skis for rock climbing gear and sunscreen. 

 

During my tenure at Arizona State University, I joined the Center for Adaptive Neural Systems, where I studied the intrinsic properties of alpha motoneurons following partial spinal cord injury. Working in mathematical neuroscience ultimately led me to the field of analytics. While conducting my research, I found that the question of how to extract and use data from the overwhelmingly large libraries of scientific literature was just as compelling as the problem I wanted to solve with the data. Furthermore, my research and classes in neuromuscular control systems gave me exposure to neural systems and predictive learning algorithms.  These experiences inspired me to learn more about how machines emulate human learning. 

 

While performing my research, I realized that although I wanted less excitement than Teach for America, academia afforded too much solitude and tedium. Realizing that my program was focused on producing academicians, funneling me into a life of low pay and grant revisions, I searched for an industry focused program after receiving my Master’s at ASU.

 

Which brings me to Northwestern, and Text Analytics. Things that our brains do seemingly effortlessly, like speak and understand speech, are enormously difficult tasks for a machine. Many of the neural network algorithms, which resemble the equations used to describe the flow of electrons and neurotransmitters, and thus information, through a neuron, successfully “learn” and process quantitative data.  I can’t help but feel that there is something we have yet to unlock, some other way in which we can use biomimicry, to enable a computer to understand what we comprehend so easily. 

 
** HW0: MEGHAN MENGHAN DING
------------------------------------------------------------

I am originally from Shenzhen, the southern part of China. I came to United State in my senior year of high school in Rochester, NY in 2009. I completed my undergraduate studies at Northwestern in 2014 with degrees in Statistics and Economics, and went on to working in investment management and project management for 2 years. After deciding to take on a more technical path in the business world, I came back to Northwestern for the MSiA program. I became interested in text analytics since I joined the MSiA program, as I have not heard about the term before that. Learning more about it through seeing other people presenting their work in text analytics, either from class or from the industry, I was amazed at the amount of value to be extracted from unstructured data, and I want to learn this powerful tool. In the future, I do planning on furthering my career in data science especially in the decision science side, and I believe text analytics and natural language processing will be one of the major distinguishing point that make me a better data scientist. Another major reason I decided to be in text analytics class is that I picked up python at MSiA and fell in love with this elegant language that I want to become better at.

 
** HW0: MATTHEW FARKAS
------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, my name is Matt Farkas and I am from Cumming, Georgia. I was born in Pennsylvania, and moved down to Georgia when I was three. Before MSiA, I was an undergraduate at the Georgia Institute of Technology studying industrial engineering. I took a computational data analysis class and worked on a few data-centric projects in undergrad that motivated me to learn more about data science, and apply to data science master's programs. 

Though the only work experience I have is a couple of internships, and no full time experience, I was exposed to some lightweight analytics in my most recent internship the summer before MSiA. In that position, I did a little bit of web scraping and visualization in Tableau. This was a good exposure and start to some of the things I would be learning about in MSiA. 

Text analytics has been interesting to me for a while, but not a serious interest until I started learning more about data science in the MSiA program. Within the program, we have had a few courses and assignments that have leveraged some text techniques that have started to show me some of the uses of text analytics. I’m really excited about this course and what we’re going to learn.

For the immediate future, I have recently accepted a full time position from the company where I interned over the summer. It was an easy decision for me; the work was interesting, the people there were awesome, and the product is something I use every day and am very excited about. In addition to that, I recently started a new venture with a couple of classmates. I’m very excited about this opportunity as well, as I’ve always been interested in entrepreneurship and the idea of starting my own company. In addition, we could actually be using text analytics at some point down the line in this venture, so this course could help me prepare for that as well.

 
** HW0: DYLAN FONTAINE
------------------------------------------------------------

I was born and raised in Orlando, Florida. I lived there my entire childhood and then attended undergrad at the University of Florida where I studied Industrial & Systems Engineering. During my time in undergrad I completed a few internships at large companies (Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Procter & Gamble). These internships were all focused on manufacturing and supply chain. I enjoyed the problem-solving aspects of these jobs, but what I enjoyed the most was the data analysis involved. My interest in data analysis inspired me to join DataSci at UF, a new club focused on data science. DataSci exposed me to many topics related to analytics and machine learning that I had never seen before. My interest was piqued, but I soon realized that I did not yet have the toolkit necessary to be a successful data scientist. I applied to MSiA to acquire that toolkit.

I was first exposed to text analytics during my first quarter at Northwestern. Professor Klabjan talked about it in his course “Analytics for a Competitive Advantage”. He taught us foundational topics such as word stemming and using a tf-idf matrix for prediction problems. I found these topics to be fascinating, but there was not time to explore them in depth since the course was a broad introductory course about all types of analytics. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge about text analytics over the next few months.

In the future I am looking forward to working as a data scientist. I am not sure where I will work yet, but I am focusing my job search on Chicago. My identical twin brother Dustin (who is also in MSiA) will be working in Chicago, so it would be great to stay close to him. Wherever I land I hope to have a challenging position where I can continue to learn and grow throughout my career.

 
** HW0: ADAM GOODKIND
------------------------------------------------------------

I am from New York City, but was raised in New Jersey. I attended college, worked and earned a master’s degree in New York City before coming to Northwestern. I have also spent time living in Salt Lake City, Utah and Seattle, Washington.

I was drawn to my current graduate program by both the people in the program and the content of the program. I am very interested in computational psycholinguistics, and experimental linguistics, in general. Northwestern has a number of linguists, psychologists and computer scientists who pursue research in these areas.

Before enrolling in the Linguistics PhD program, I pursued a master’s degree in Computational Linguistics in addition to working in finance. I worked in private wealth management for a large investment bank, tasked with transferring assets as well as improving workflows. In the course of pursuing my master’s degree, I conducted research on keystroke dynamics, or deducing patterns in typing rhythms that can be used to identify both the typist as well as what is being typed.

I actually became interested in text analytics while working in finance. One of the processes we were trying to improve dealt with the transfer of assets both into and out of the firm. Certain classes of assets were deemed more risky or volatile than others; these assets needed to be flagged for closer inspection before they either left the firm or came into its holdings. A number of the asset classes were identifiable by certain text patterns in their descriptions, although the wording in the descriptions was not always consistent. Using rudimentary natural language processing, we were able to catch all of the assets in special classifications, and save time for those handling processing. This saved the firm money both by reducing human capital and mitigating risk by flagging all appropriate assets.

The only future I can see is completing my PhD… But if I have to look beyond that, I could see myself as either a professor at a research institution or working in natural language processing for a software company. Many large software companies, like Google and Microsoft, have large and cutting-edge research facilities, working on both product-oriented and theoretical research.

In my spare time I enjoy playing golf and racquetball. I also enjoy reading and writing, and am learning to draw and paint. I live in Edgewater with my girlfriend, who is a research assistant for a psychology professor.

 
** HW0: JULIA GREENBERGER
------------------------------------------------------------

I was born and raised right here in Evanston, IL, just a short bike ride from campus. I grew up on pancakes from Walker Brothers and shwarma from Pita Inn. I attended Washington University in St. Louis where I earned a B.S. in systems engineering and minored in mathematics. My desire to apply math to make real world business decisions led me to the field of economic consulting after graduation.

Over the next four years in Washington, D.C., I worked for two economic consulting firms. I spent the first two years working in antitrust, analyzing pricing effects of mergers and acquisitions. In my next position I transitioned to the energy and electricity industry. I conducted analyses of federal climate proposals using a quadratic programming model that quantified electric sector and macroeconomic impacts.

Having worked as an analyst bounded by the confines of Microsoft Excel, I chose to study analytics to expand my technical skill set. I wanted to learn how to make predictions and work with "big" datasets to be able to help companies make important and informed decisions.

The first year of MSiA provided me with a basic understanding of how to work with text data-- topic modeling, sentiment analysis, regex-- but my education lacks a formal foundation in text analytics. I hope this course will give me a strong foundation that allows me to confidently work with text datasets in my career and understand the underlying algorithms and assumptions.

In my future career, I hope to work for a company that uses data to make a positive impact on the environment. I am especially interested in solar and wind energy and electric vehicles. I believe investment in these industries will continue to grow as more firms and individuals choose to mitigate the risk of having an energy supply heavily dependent on fossil fuels.

 
** HW0: MADHURI GUPTA
------------------------------------------------------------

I am Madhuri Gupta, graduate student in Masters of Science in Analytics (MSiA) program at Northwestern University. Born and brought up in India, I did my undergrad in Instrumentation and Control Engineering. After graduating in 2010, I worked in analyzing signal data obtained from sensors across thermal power plants. The objective was to prevent a plant from tripping; tripping leads to huge losses in both time and money. While working on predicting a trip event, I realized I wanted to get a formal treatment of the subject. I started looking online for various courses and programs offering analytics education. Data Science Specialization on Coursera provided by John Hopkins University seemed suitable to gauge my level of interest int he field. It was a 10-course specialization. I found it extremely intuitive and interesting.

During my Capstone project for the specialization, I built a “Next Word Predictor App” which would take in an input word/phrase and output the next probable word. It was not as sophisticated as it might have been if I had text analytics expertise. I used n-grams to predict the next word based on weighted observed frequency of a phrase.

Meanwhile, I started looking for the best programs offering Analytics/ Data Science degree and Northwestern was on the top of the list. I applied to the MSiA program and got accepted. Later in the 1st quarter of the program I was a part of a text analytics project for Studio Gang Architects. The objective was to do popular sentiment analysis for the buildings constructed by Studio Gang and find out what users have to say about them - is it positive or negative. We used some text mining techniques like document feature matrix and tf-idf.

Further, when I was looking at the electives for the fall quarter this year I found text analytics as an option. This looked like a great opportunity to learn the skill in depth. It would give me a chance to explore a wide variety of techniques and their underlying assumptions. I hope it would empower me to understand which technique is best for which situation.

In future, I intend to deploy the skills I have learnt during the program to solve business problems by coming up with interesting analytical solutions and extracting business value from them.

 
** HW0: SAI HARAN
------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Sai Haran. I was born and raised in the suburbs of Massachusetts, spending most of my childhood in the quiet town of Bedford, MA. After graduating high school I attended Georgetown University to study economics and music, and subsequently returned to Boston to try to work my way into the startup scene. This didn’t work as well as I’d hoped, and after several months without a consistent and livable paycheck, I joined a financial software company called Eze Software Group as a technical consultant.

 

At Eze I moved away from my economics background and focused on my technical skills, such as SQL and C# coding. While much different from my education, it was a nice change of pace and I found the work challenging. Working with some of the largest financial institutions in the world, while stressful, was also a great experience to have under my belt.

 

After two years working in the fintech space, I wanted to return to the analytical roots I developed in undergrad studying Economics. I looked at several programs and landed on Northwestern as being the best balance of statistics, computer science, and networking opportunities. I’d say my choice was the right one, judging by the material I’ve learned, the people I’ve met, and the experience as a whole.

 

Text analytics has been an interest of mine since before the program because my mother works in the field. I’ve heard bits and pieces of what she’s worked on in the past, and with the data science knowledge I’ve picked up in the past year I’ve begun to understand a small fraction of what she’s built her career on. I’m excited to continue to learn about text analytics to further understand her career, and besides, it’s a great skill to have in any data scientist’s toolbox.

 

Moving forward, in the short term I’d like to work in ecommerce or the video game industry. Both have vast opportunities to make a difference with data science techniques, including text analytics. Ecommerce is built around the customer, and being able to understand customer sentiment and feedback without manually parsing through responses. The same can be said for the video game industry, where games are evolving into a more social experience involving communication amongst gamers and feedback from gamers to developers. Long term, I’d like to move back into the startup space and possibly start my own company. I’m hoping the experience I gain working in data science gives me enough insight into what makes products succeed to help me succeed as an entrepreneur.

 

 

 
** HW0: ROHAN JHA
------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Mithrandir and I am a wizard in Middle-earth and a member of the Istari order. I was the last Istari to have reached the Havens of Mithlond. In recent times, I am more commonly referred as Gandalf the Grey. I am also the bearer of the elven Ring of Power, Narya (Ring of Fire), given to me by Cirdan himself. As a result, you could think of fire being my natural spirit element. I am particularly adept with fire and enjoy creating grand displays of fiery art in the sky as a creative outlet and also for the amusement of some of my friends (mostly Hobbits). As a wizard, I am entrusted with the task of providing counsel to Men, Elves and all who oppose Sauron. I have been travelling extensively across Middle-earth in search of information around Sauron's resurgence and Bilbo's mysterious ring that he acquired from the creature Gollum.

There is an immense wealth of information and having the power of text analytics will surely assist me in my quest to get more information around the ring. I have suspicions that this ring could be the One Ring and hence it is imperative that I learn more about it. I am particularly interested in regular expressions as they would greatly increase my search capabilities in the archives of Minas Tirith. Another useful application would be in translating the works across the various Elvish and Dwarvish languages so that others who don't speak the languages can still benefit from the knowledge passed down by the great ancestors.

After graduation, my first task would be to confirm my suspicion about the One Ring. If it indeed happens to be it, then I would seek the counsel of Saruman the White and inform Elrond so that a plan of action could be created to destroy the ring. Stopping the resurgence of Sauron is of utmost priority for the safety of Middle-earth.

 
** HW0: IN SIK JUNG
------------------------------------------------------------

I am from Seoul, Korea. I grew up there since I was 15 and moved to Shanghai, China, to attend high school. Then, I moved to Los Angeles, CA, to attend UCLA. Now, I am here in Evanston, IL.

I came to MSiA because I wanted to be in data science field. I first heard about this field when I took statistics and econometrics courses at UCLA. I got fascinated and wanted to learn more about it. So while I was working, I took data science courses online and applied to graduate programs to fully immerse myself in data science. As to why Northwestern, I was visiting friends in Evanston in the summer of 2015 and got to visit Northwestern campus, which I thought was beautiful. Little did I know how bad the winter was.
 
Before coming to MSiA, I was working as a consultant at Deloitte in Los Angeles. I worked in the financial transactions group where we did accounting consulting for initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions, and other types of financial transactions. Even though I was doing very non-data-science work, I had opportunities to work with Deloitte Analytics group where I used SAS to analyze transaction data for various clients. 
 
I got interested in text analytics when I took Professor Diego’s class in the Fall. We used various text analytics methods­­—such as regular expression, topic modeling, TF-IDF, and latent Dirichlet allocation—to parse and analyze emails received by MSiA. We used these methods to cluster emails and recommend past answers to future emails. Also, during my practicum with GoGo, we used various text analytics method such as Word2Vec to cluster texts.
 
My immediate plan is to find a company who has interesting data and product that I can be passionate about. And I will see where it takes me from there.

 
** HW0: MICHAEL KAESLER
------------------------------------------------------------

I was born in Clarendon Hills, IL, a suburb west of Chicago. After high school, I attended the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado. I graduated with majors in Mathematics and Economics and a minor in Computer Science, however there were a few interesting major changes in-between. I originally enrolled intending on taking the pre-med track, however a strong aversion to chemistry my freshman year caused a brief foray into English. That lasted a semester. After that brief stint I switched to Economics, and started adding majors and minors from there. Originally the plan was to get into quantitative finance, however somewhere along the line I lost interest and simultaneously discovered the field of data science.

 

After graduating, I interned at Ecolab in Naperville, IL as a Data Science Intern. It was there that I had my first experience with text analytics. In order to merge a pair of databases for predictive analysis, I was forced to use some fuzzy matching techniques. Along with regular expressions, I used edit distances to measure the similarity between strings in particular fields to determine if they were indeed a match.

 

After completing my internship, I enrolled at Northwestern University in the Masters in Analytics program. Students in MSiA are assigned to consult for a particular company throughout their first three quarters of the program. The company's project I was assigned too actually required similar text matching to what I had done at Ecolab. Although this time we were searching the database based off fuzzy string matching, not just merging two databases one time. Consequently, search speed was of a higher importance than overall accuracy, as the user was able to remove unwanted items. As such, more focus was placed on regular expressions than edit distances.

 

In the future, I want to be employed as a Data Scientist.

 
** HW0: IKHWAN KIM
------------------------------------------------------------

Hi. I’m Ik-Hwan and I am from Seoul, South Korea. I graduated from Northwestern University with Bachelor’s degree in Economics in 2015. 

I was fascinated by the power of machine learning and its adaptibility in economic and statistical analysis, and that was why I studied multiple programming languages and statistics during my undergraduate career. While my work at Resolution Economics LLC after graduation, my passion to handle data that is material to everyday life has grown. During my career as an economic consultant, I analyzed data to estimate damages in class action lawsuits and was involved in a lot of data wrangling as well as extracting quantitative data from text data. My work in the this field led me to be more interested in data science and analytics that eventually led me to MSiA program. I was happy with descriptive analysis work I was doing at the time, but I wanted more solid understanding in Machine learning and other predictive analytics tools so that I can proficiently deal with broader range of data. 

Text analytics was especially interesting because it is difficult to quantify or aggregate free-form text, and I have witnessed numerous occasions where companies struggle to extract meaningful insights from text data. I had personal experience dealing with e-mails or bodies of feedbacks from the customers and struggled to automate the data processing as the dataset scaled. Given the fact that these types of text data are growing by the day, being able to process and draw value from natural language seems to have become a skillset that is extremely valuable. I plan to work inside a tech industry for the foreseeable future, although I believe skills I gained in the program are transferable in multiple industries. I expect to utilize tools I learned including text analytics actively in my career as a data scientist.

 
** HW0: ROSHAN KUMAR
------------------------------------------------------------

I am from India with an Integrated Master’s degree in Mathematics & Computing from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. During this time, I also worked as a research intern at INRIA Grenoble, France. Before coming to this program, I have worked for over 5 years in analytics. I started my professional career with Oracle in their analytics division where I learned to develop different modelling techniques in R for different banking clients. After working for 3 years in Oracle, I decided to work in a different domain. My passion for analytics helped me rise to a leadership role in analytics at Tesco. This experience involved interacting extensively with UK stakeholders and director level executives to understand the business needs and solve them using modeling techniques. After working in analytics for few years I wanted to study more about data science and hence I enrolled in Northwestern’s analytics program.

I have realized text analytics is important for any data scientist. Data present in today’s world in not clean and data preprocessing is important hence text analytics is an important tool for any data scientist. Also, I like the course content and I am interested to learn about Text analytics preprocessing, document clustering, retrieval, sentiment analysis, POST, and name entity recognition (NER).

In the future, I want to work for a company where I can do prediction mainly related to customer behavior and impact a huge mass through my work. I am also interested to know more about latest technologies and real-time analytics in particular. For my long term goal, I see myself as Chief Analytics Officer of a company driving important business decisions and managing a group of data scientists.

On a personal front, I like to dance and play ping pong. I am trained in salsa, jive and bachata and have performed stage shows in the past. Also, I recently discovered that I like hiking and travelling and all sorts of water sports. I have also been to France, Italy, Netherlands and Switzerland. This was my first time in USA and I hope to meet new people and make amazing friends during my stay here.

 
** HW0: KATE LARSEN
------------------------------------------------------------

While I have lived up and down the East Coast from upstate New York to South Florida, and a brief stint in Mexico, I have spent most of my life in Virginia. 

I did my undergrad at the University of Virginia majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math. I then worked at Deloitte Consulting in Washington, D.C. for two years. I worked primarily as an ETL developer where I captured and transformed source data from large industrial machines to enable operational decision making and insight. Much of the work was descriptive in nature, and I looked to graduate school to transition to more predictive and prescriptive analytics. 

My main motivation to join MSiA was to learn the tools and the underlying algorithms and statistics implemented for data science problems within the context of real industry projects. I had a good amount of technical experience, but wanted to increase my statistics knowledge in the field.

This past summer, I worked at Nike on the North America Analytics Team as a Data Science intern. While most of my work dealt with numerical bookings and account data, I saw the opportunity for text analytics in product descriptions to investigate product genealogy. 

I became most interested in text analytics while working on different projects last year in MSiA. I saw many opportunities to derive information and interesting perspective from text, but had not studied the topic of text analytics too deeply. I briefly worked on text analysis with Yelp description data to see sentiment on Chicago culture, and again with airbnb host and posting descriptions to find unique properties.

In the future, I look forward to leading actionable data driven analysis in companies. I am most interested in either a small, boutique data science consulting firm, or companies in the health and fitness industry. Not only do I find the technical nature of this field challenging and intriguing, but I am also interested in understanding the impact and translating the results back to the business.

HW0: Introduction
Aron Liu

After growing up in Wisconsin, I moved to the east coast to attend Dartmouth College where I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in June 2015. I majored in both mathematics and economics modified with computer science, specifically focusing on statistics, financial mathematics, and analysis of economic data. After graduation, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to work as an Actuarial Analyst. I valuated and administrated many different qualified retirement and pension plans, calculated and reviewed numerous actuarial costs, and worked closely with investment institutions to allocate contributions and monitor trusts. After working for a year in the actuarial field, I wanted to pivot to a more technical career path. I felt like continuing my education with a master's degree would be the best way to do this, which is what brought me to the Master of Science in Analytics program at Northwestern University.

I'm interested in text analytics because I think it's currently one of the most universally applicable and in-demand skills for data scientists now. There's a lot of hype nowadays around extracting value from unstructured data and text analytics seems to be one of the most developed and formalized areas related to analyzing unstructured data. Text analytics is also completely different from other classes we've had in the program, which have been more focused on structured numerical and categorical data, and I think having a more comprehensive and well-rounded education in handling all types of data is important. I've worked on text analytics projects throughout the MSiA program and my internship, but it's always been self-learning by searching on the internet. I think that learning text analytics in a formal setting would be extremely beneficial to strengthen and internalize my base knowledge of the subject. After graduation, I'm planning on working in an analytics role for a company in Chicago.

 
** HW0: MING YU LIU
------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, my name is Ethen and I am from the MSIA program. Prior coming to the MSIA program, I did my undergrad back in Taipei, Taiwan in Industrial Management from National Taiwan University of Science and Technology. The reason for coming to the program was I started taking a couple of computer science and analytics courses during my junior year and found out I enjoy expressing logic with code, working with data and deriving insights from it. That little detour from my major made me certain that I wanted to learn more about analytics, and more so, decided I wish to pursue an advanced degree in related fields. 

After doing a bit of research, I feel like MSIA aims to be a program that strikes a good balance between the theory and applied part of data science, thus I struggled through the GRE test, applied to the program and thankfully was accepted.

I became interested in text analytics when I came across methods for dealing with the cold start problem for recommendation system (note: cold start is basically where a user or a product has not interacted with the system, thus we can’t leverage canonical machine learning algorithm because there is no prior history to work with). In that scenario, a product’s item description can be used as a feature to provide additional side information to the task, making this problem still feasible to solve. This is when I realized having a working knowledge to perform text analytics is highly beneficial to the field I am interested in.

My plan for the near future is to aim for a machine learning engineer or a more technical data scientist role in the field of recommendation system. After getting some years of industrial hands-on experience in a more technical role, maybe consider transitioning into a more business-oriented data science role. 

 
** HW0: KRISTIN MEIER
------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Kristin Meier and I grew up on Long Island in New York. I attended George Washington University where I majored in Economics and minored in Mathematics and Statistics. Throughout my studies I became increasingly interested in learning how to use data analysis to solve real-world problems. After graduating, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.

While at the Federal Reserve, I had the opportunity to work on many projects that inspired my interest in data analytics. I became more interested in programming while working in R and wanted to expand my data analysis toolkit. I sought to build on my educational foundation and work experience both in the classroom and through practical application. The Master of Science in Analytics program offered the perfect opportunity to advance my skills and combined several subject areas that interested me.

Until recently, I hadn’t thought too much about how to quantify textual data. After briefly learning about a few techniques, I became interested in text analytics and expanding my knowledge of the subject. There are a lot of unstructured data in the world and it will be extremely beneficial to know how to extract information from it to use to my or my employers advantage. At my internship this summer at a policy research organization, I learned about an interesting project using text analytics to classify domestic abuse cases in crisis text hotline data. The applications of text analytics are immense.

My future plans include finding a job in data science that enables me to contribute business value to a company. I hope to work somewhere I can continue growing as a data scientist and polish my machine learning skills. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.

In my free time I enjoy travelling, sports, and exploring new areas of the city.

 
** HW0: NICOLE MIREA
------------------------------------------------------------

I was born and raised in Los Angeles. Specifically, most of my growing-up was done in Westwood, less than a mile from the University of California, Los Angeles. Eventually, my parents moved to Glendale, but less than a year later, I returned to UCLA to study cognitive science as an undergraduate. Sometimes, on especially restless nights, I would go on walks through the old neighborhood, retracing my childhood steps, checking to see whether my memories still squared with reality. If I couldn't manage to change my geographic location, at least I could search for the ways it changed around me. I found novelty in time.

During my first year at UCLA, I took a course on myths, legends, and folktales. Hearing about myths from so many cultures made me wonder if there could be some commonalities between them, and whether they might share plotlines and character archetypes with modern urban legends. Surely, a person would never be able to absorb and analyze all lore from every culture within a single lifetime—leaving aside the fact that most cultures do not share the same language. But what if a computer could perform this task? This sparked my interest in text analytics. I registered a domain name and planned to make the website into a folklore database, where people from around the world could submit myths and legends from their culture. Unfortunately, this plan did not come to fruition. (But I still have the domain name!)

The story of how I came to study linguistics at Northwestern is a bit improbable. As an undergrad, I never wanted to go to grad school. I'd look at the other students in my labs who were clearly angling for it and marvel at their enthusiasm. In reality, this reluctance was a fable I told myself whenever things weren't going as planned. Classic sour grapes. "Whatever," I'd think after messing up an experiment or getting a bad grade, "it's not like I actually want to go to grad school anyway." I was afraid to want it, because I didn't think I was smart enough.

Eventually, through meeting more and more grad students, I figured out I didn't have to be a genius in order to succeed: I just had to be inquisitive and hardworking. Ultimately, any career I chose would involve the downsides I'd found in academia, so there was no real reason to disprefer it to any other job. In addition, my skillset was best-suited to a profession in the tech industry, with which I was entirely disillusioned. The technologies that had promised to connect us and give everyone a voice had only further consolidated control in the hands of a few, with information as capital. I didn't want to be complicit, and it was impossible to sustain myself by working only on open-source projects. Academia was the solution to a constraint-satisfaction problem: it was the only viable path where my skills could be put to good use without making the world worse.

My future is flexible and filled with choice points. For now, I intend see whether I like teaching, finish my PhD program, and see what the job market looks like in 2021.

 
** HW0: CRAIG NG
------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Craig Ng and I was born and raised in San Francisco. I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and held a variety of progressively analytical roles prior to graduate school including working as an auditor and a management consultant. I discovered that I enjoyed working with data, but didn’t have the skills necessary to tackle problems at any type of scale. Although I considered acquiring those skills through alternative means such as MOOCs or a boot camp, I ultimately decided that coming back to school full-time, completely focused on learning and leaving with a degree, was the right choice for me.

 

I’ve always had a fascination with language and devoured books of all types starting at a young age. Even though I’m getting an advanced degree in a technical field, I’m the type of person who scores higher on the verbal portion than the quantitative portion of standardized exams. In an alternate universe, I’d probably be studying history…which I might still do after retirement. As people and companies become more aware of the amount of information stored in unstructured data, understanding how to parse and analyze that data becomes increasingly important. I think we’ve only seen the tip of the iceberg when it comes to text analytics and I want to build the foundational skills necessary to explore that further.

 

As someone who grew up in the heart of the Silicon Valley and has been a part of seemingly every type of organization but, I would love to work with data at a startup immediately after graduation. I intend to work hands-on with the data as an individual contributor for 3-5 years and then re-evaluate from there. I have other hobbies like weightlifting, baking and cars, so I’ll likely be looking for opportunities to combine data science with one (or more) of those things at some point!

 
** HW0: SANTIAGO OLIVAR AICINENA
------------------------------------------------------------

I was born and raised in Mexico City, I received my B.A. in Economics from the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM) in 2016. I worked over a year for the Mexican Federal Ministry of Economy and then for three years for the Bank of Mexico as a financial researcher. In the latter position, I was given the responsibility of gathering and analyzing big and diverse datasets, with the final objective of presenting results to the Board of Governors. While working on these I gained experience at working with huge databases. At first, this was a challenge, as I did not have the programming skills in order to assess a big, diverse dataset that increased from day to day. This was a significant handicap for me, so I decided to learn by myself new programming languages such as R, SQL, and Python to overcome this situation. As a result, I discovered that I could use leadership, quantitative and programming skills in contribution toward institution’s revenues and data-driven insights.

I preferred the Master of Science in Analytics program over other similar ones because students are taught the skills that drive business success in today's data-driven world. Moving beyond simple data analysis, this program seeks to equip students with the technical knowledge and business acumen that are necessary for translating complex data sets into meaningful information. 

I started to become interested in text analytics after noticing that many internships and full-time positions were requiring experience in Text Analytics and Natural Language Processing. Also, I realized that most of the data that is generated today is unstructured and a Text Analytics toolbox is very important for getting data-driven insights.

Despite my background in the financial arena, I believe that graduates from the MSiA Program could work in almost any industry. I feel challenged and fortunate to be living in this moment of time where the torrent of new data that has been created represents a unique moment to assess opportunities and add value within institutions and along industries.

 
** HW0: JOSE MARIA SERIO PASTOR
------------------------------------------------------------

Born and raised in Manila, Philippines, I attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I graduated with a B.S. in Industrial Engineering with a concentration in Operations Research. I complimented my technical training with involvement with international companies and Fortune 500 companies in semester-long projects throughout his college career in consulting. Regular client interface and exposure to front-ends of various businesses each grappling with a specific problem confirmed his desire to hone his skills in data analysis and statistics and ultimately, my ability to parlay quantitative skills to develop practical business solutions.
My engineering and management consulting experience encouraged me to pursue a career to assist organizations with optimizing their operations, more specifically, developing pricing and revenue strategies. The MSiA program at Northwestern University, bridges the gap between managerial and engineering perspectives in problem solving, and it is the rigorous study in mathematical and statistical methods that compelled me to apply. Learning from faculty, company partners and peers in optimization and heuristics, big data analytics, and data mining classes will strengthen skills that I already acquired through undergraduate coursework and involvement with consulting.
Text analytics started to become interesting to me over the summer where I worked as a Data Scientist for a political consulting firm. For the first few weeks, I noticed that a considerable amount of the data I received, be it scraped from websites, bought from a third party, or collected through an API, was unstructured and more often than not, textual. I then realized that I needed formal training in analyzing textual data as everyday, the amount of text data grows.
Over the summer, I mostly worked on sentiment analysis using the VADER algorithm in the nltk package in python. I also dabbed into some sentiment analysis in a language other than English using a third party API call.

 
** HW0: ERIC PAWLAKOS
------------------------------------------------------------

I was born and raised in the Bay Area. I grew up in Walnut Creek before moving around during 8th grade. I was brought to MSiA because of my interest in statistics. My undergraduate major was in Math/Econ, but I found my most interesting classes to be statistics and econometrics. Most of my opportunities were within the financial industry, but I was interested in learning more about data analysis and to have the opportunity to explore other industries.

Before this program, I was an undergraduate student at UCLA studying math/econ. I also was interning for a financial firm in San Francisco, writing company valuation reports (potential for growth, experience of management) to determine if a company should be invested in.

I became interested in text analytics as it is one of the areas that no other classes in the program have covered. Also, due to the large amounts of data stored in text, it seems that text analytics is quite important for a data scientist to know.

My plans, for the future, are to find a job. Ideally, in a location I haven’t been before. Since I haven’t spent much time in the east coast I am looking for opportunities there.

I need to include additional stuff to hit the 300-600 word limit. A bit more about me. I attended UCDavis for 2 years before UCLA. I switched my major about 4 times while I was at Davis. I found the campus at UCLA to be one of the favorite campuses I have been on. I played rugby throughout high school and most of college, but I stopped playing at UCLA. I’ve been playing guitar since high school, but mainly casually and for fun.

I have two siblings; an older and a younger brother. The older one went to college at UC Berkeley and has since graduated. My younger one just started high school.

 

 
** HW0: ASHLEY THOMAS
------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Rose Thomas (however my legal name is Ashley Elizabeth Thomas, but I’ll address that later). I am from Houma, LA, which is a small town/city southwest of New Orleans. I came straight out of undergrad before coming to MSiA, and my reasons for doing so were a mixture of continuing my education in an area that was widely applicable and pretty interesting to me and avoiding the “real working” world to gain more of a sense of direction. Before this program, my only work experience were two investment banking internships. As far as schooling goes, I was an Economics-Mathematics student at NYU for two years, and then I transferred to Brown University and graduated in Applied Mathematics. In school, I danced a great deal in student groups, and I continue to do so here at Northwestern. I am currently in two dance groups here on campus, one that does primarily hip hop and another that is mostly contemporary and jazz. However, I have danced many more styles than these two, including: ballet, tap, bollywood, pole dance, broadway, and general “dance team” style. I became interested in text analytics through talking to other people and going through my own personal pains when trying to digest large bodies of text into more usable data. My current plans for the future are to work for CenturyLink in a Senior Analyst role and to try to dance professionally either on the side or by taking time off. Finally, as I previously promised, I thought I might explain why I go by Rose. I chose it as my French class name in 9th grade, and as I continued to take French through the rest of high school, my classmates began calling me Rose outside of the classroom as well as within. This spread to classmates who weren’t even taking French and to other friends and teachers. I really enjoyed the name, and for some reason it felt like a better fit than Ashley. So when I went to college, I just started going by Rose. If someone calls me Ashley, I will definitely still answer, so don’t worry if it ever happens!

 
** HW0: ADITYA VENKATARAMAN
------------------------------------------------------------

I am Aditya Venkataraman from America. I say that because I have lived in 11 states relatively evenly distributed throughout my young life. I currently reside in Lafayette CA, but I was born and raised mostly in the South and Midwest. I attended Carnegie Mellon University for my undergrad and graduated last year in 2016.  I was originally an Electrical and Computer Engineering major at my undergrad but I was not happy and hated it eventually switching to Civil Engineering with a minor in Statistics. During my sophomore summer I took a probability theory class and was captivated by the endless possibilities and applications of statistics. I then decided to switch my major to statistics and minor in civil and environmental engineering just flip-flopping what I was studying earlier. During my senior spring I took a natural language processing class that was taught from a more statistics perspective rather than a computer science perspective. That class opened me up to the possibility of working with unstructured text data from a statistical perspective and all the different possibilities for statistical analysis. I learned about interesting topics like n-grams, Hidden Markov Models, the Viterbi Algorithm and other interesting things in the realm of stats. My future plans would be to work for a company where I can work with smart motivated people and do engaging work. The type of industry doesn’t matter so much to me and having this broad exposure will allow me to specialize a bit more and pinpoint what I want to do further in my career further down the road. I would like to work back in the West Coast as it is close to family and I can do all the outdoors-y activities I am interested in as well while being close to friends.

 
** HW0: XINGYU WANG
------------------------------------------------------------

Hi everyone. I’m Xingyu Wang. I graduated from Peking University, China with B.S. in Psychology and Applied Mathematics. During my freshman year, I sharpened his programming skills by taking most freshman courses for CS majors. When studying applied math, I enjoyed both the theoretical and practical sides of quantitative methodologies, which were covered and utilized in courses like operation research and statistical learning. Along with my studying in psychology, I participated in a variety of research projects, during which I coded my own experiment/simulation scripts and identified patterns of decision-making processes revealed by the data. In one of the research, I proposed and tested a model for human's saccade (rapid eye movement) during decision making. Based on Bayesian updating and statistical inferences, the model theoretically predicted eye-movement patterns and successfully fit with empirical data in MATLAB simulation. I’ve tuned another two models when analyzing Chinese college entrance exams' records, which verified mental and motivational influencers on exam performances. In a word, it’s the combination of the three disciplines that intrigues me and has led me to the studying of data science and analytics.

 

Before joining MSIA, I have also worked as an intern data analyst in a Chinese online education platform. By devising surveys and analyzing records in the database, I trained a predicting model for churn rate and identified efficient advertising strategies when targeting different users.

 

I’ve got a flavor of text analytics during my quarter at MSIA. In one of the course projects, our team employed LDA to extract topics from millions of job posts and grouped them accordingly for further analysis. The very technique of topic modelling and its underlying theories are part of reasons I’m taking text analytics course. Besides, I’ve always been interested in machine learning/statistical learning. So far, I’ve worked on structured data as well as images, but I believe the paradigm of working with text would be unique at many different levels. Whether it’s for performing prediction/classification based on given text or generating meaningful texts, I hope to get a better understanding of what’s the best NLP or text analytics can do now, and what would be the state-of-the-art way to attack each problem. In the future, I wish to deepen my understanding of machine learning and the optimization techniques involved by working on more projects.

 

 

 
** HW0: CHRISTOPHER WARD
------------------------------------------------------------

My hometown is Eastlake, Ohio, which is approximately 20 miles from downtown Cleveland. I attended

The Ohio State University for my undergraduate studies. During these studies I majored in Accounting via OSU’s prestigious Accounting Honors program. I also earned minors in Mathematics and Economics.

 

After graduating from Ohio State I made my way to Chicago. Chicagoland has been my home for the last five years, and I deem myself to be a dual citizen of Chicago and Cleveland. In the first four of those years I was employed by the multinational accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP as an auditor of financial services firms. I specialized in brokers & dealers, private equity funds, mutual funds, and proprietary trading companies. Many of my clients were highly profitable. I would like to believe their success was due to my auditing skills, but this is most definitely a situation where correlation did not imply causation.

 

Life as an auditor was demanding but provided many phenomenal learning opportunities. By the age of 25 I had multiple people working under my direction which is an experience that is not found in many jobs. Further, I was able to build many strong relationships that remain amongst the most important ones in my life.

 

One joke I heard about accounting was “creative accountants go to jail.” This comment encapsulates my rationale for leaving the world of accounting. An accountant who encounters an unfamiliar issue has a definitive way to proceed: consult the accounting guidance. The rules for accounting are codified and highly detailed. Thus, anyone who is practicing new or creative accounting might be performing an illegal act. On the other hand, unfamiliar issues are the bedrock of what makes analytics fascinating. The best insights and discoveries often begin when people ponder a question and their responses are “I don’t know.”

 

Along these lines, one of the most interesting sources of data available is free text. Humans are uniquely differentiated from other life forms due to our ability to think critically and express our thoughts, opinions, and emotions to each other via written language. Our writing provides massive amounts of data that, with the help of advances in computing power, can be analyzed to learn more about ourselves, our species, and how we interact with each other and the world around us.

 

As for my future, I recently signed a lease for a condo in downtown Chicago and plan to stay there for the foreseeable future. The location is very convenient as it provides easy access to many forms of transportation, restaurants, groceries, and nightlife. Additionally, I have already accepted a full-time job offer from TransUnion. Their office is across the street from my residence which means I will have one of the easiest commutes ever.

 

Last, but certainly not at all least, I am looking forward to this year’s baseball playoffs and am hopeful that my Cleveland Indians will be able to complete their unfinished business and avenge their defeat in last year’s World Series that occurred on account of my Chicago Cubs.

 
** HW0: CHAORAN WEI
------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Chaoran Wei from MSiA program. I am from China. During my undergraduate, I did some research projects in machine learning and was interested in the idea of solving real world problem with data. That’s why I chose to go to MSiA to get my master degree and want to become a data scientist in the future.

 

I have been investigating machine learning for about two years before I came to MSiA, and my biggest research project attempts to classify the image data of plankton to a specific species. The primary method the group used is deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The research results in one conference presentation in JMM (Joint Mathematics Meetings) special session.

 

I have tried out a variety of text analytics algorithms during my undergraduate study. Once I used topic modeling technique to extract different topics from research papers in International Relations realm. The result was exciting but less interpretable. The other time I used LSTM to try to generate text from Wall Street Journal, and it turned out the model couldn’t generate any meaningful words even after days of training. So I tried out a bunch of methods and did not get very good and interpretable results. That’s part of the reason why I want to take this course, to get an idea of what model to use for a particular text analytics problem and how to use it, by delving deeper into the theory of NLP.

 

My future plan is to become a data scientist. I like the idea of extracting meaningful information and patterns from large dataset, while bringing business value to the company. It feels like solving the puzzles for money. With the increasingly amount of text data from very diverse sources present in the web, I believe Text Analytics class this quarter will serve me well for my future career.

 
** HW0: LAUREN YU
------------------------------------------------------------

My name is Lauren and I come from central China. Before MSiA, I was a math major in SUNY Buffalo and dabbled a lot in social science. I discovered data science/analytics through quantitative social science research, where a lot of statistical methods were deployed. Although I didn’t personally engage in any text analytics projects at that time, there has definitely been significant research work and interest in this area. Social sciences offer a great range of interesting problems that involves natural language processing. For instance, what does a text tell us about what the author’s intents and biases are? Can we measure how much a therapist empathizes with patients? University of Washington’s NLP group, for example, has collaborated widely with political scientists, psychologists and other social scientists to tackle these kinds of questions. I remember seeing a paper with the title of “contextualized sarcasm detection in Twitter”, which is so cool! Sarcasm could be very subtle in nature and depends highly on the subject matter --- in many cases, it is almost like insider jokes. To be able to detect it algorithmically sounds like a great idea.

For my future, I hope to be working on projects that I enjoy, live in a city with decent public transportation, lots of Korean food and earn enough money to actually adopt a panda bear. Watching panda videos is probably my biggest addiction. There’s just something so hypnotizing about these bears, even when they are just rolling, munching bamboos, sleeping, playing with their keepers, playing with each other, playing in the snow, playing with their toys or just doing nothing in general. Pandas can spend up to 14 hours a day sleeping and eat up to 20lbs of bamboo shoots a day. They have the best lifestyle: eat, sleep, repeat!

Ok, I should stop trolling. Should have reached 300 words already at this point!

 
** HW0: KEVIN ZHAI
------------------------------------------------------------

Some years ago, my dad was an studying English in college in Nanjing, China. One day, a history professor from the US came to his college to give a lecture and my dad was chosen to be his translator. After the lecture, the professor and my dad talked and, for one reason or another, my dad decided to get a PhD in history in the States with the professor. After he finished his PhD, he found a job in Montgomery, AL as a professor and moved the whole family to this new land. So that’s how I ended up  being born in Montgomery.

 

Fast forward 18 years – its 2011 and its time to pick a college. I hadn’t lived anywhere but that quaint little city my whole life, so I knew it was time to pack up and grit my teeth elsewhere. I ended up at UPenn studying Materials Science. Why did I chose this major? Probably because of wanderlust – I thought it looked cool and I didn’t really know what else fancied my interest. By the time I graduated, I reazlied that working in the lab or running simulations on molecules wasn’t my calling. Wanting to leverage my computer science skills, I decided that data science was the right path for me. I applied for graduate school right after my bachelors and luckily got accepted into this great program at Northwestern.

 

In my first quarter here, I took a survey class looking at the various use cases and capabilities of analytics. Specifically, my team project was topic modelling on a corpus of research papers to look at how different topics evolved over the years. As my first foray into the power of text crunching and NLP, I was very amazed by how powerful it was. It certainly has its pitfalls as any methodology does, but it showed a lot of promise. In terms of future plans, the world is my oyster and I am the patron in the seafood restaurant.

 

To spice things up (and since I have hit my 300 minimum word count already), I have decided to insert an excerpt from the Kama Sutra: “What makes one attractive are appearance, quality, age and liberality. A paste of rosebay, wild ginger and plum leaves can make one seductive. So can a salve for the eyes made by grinding these same herbs, putting the powder on a wick and burning it with myrobalan oil in a human skull. … Licking a paste of honey and ghee mixed with a powder of dried red and blue lotus and rose chestnut makes a person attractive. … The eye of a peacock or a hyena, put inside a locket of gold and worn on the right hand, also renders one attractive. Place the bristles of certain insects which are born from trees on the penis and massage it with oil. Done for ten nights and then repeated, this will make the penis swell. Then lie face downward on a string cot and let the penis hang down through it. This process should be concluded gradually relieving any pain with cold salves. The swelling lasts for life.”
